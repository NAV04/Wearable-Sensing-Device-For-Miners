# Wearable-Sensing-Device-For-Miners
The wearable sensing device here is a safety jacket that leverages modern sensor technology and IoT to enhance the safety and monitoring of miners in hazardous environments.
The system integrates an ESP, MQ-6 gas sensor, BMP180 barometric pressure sensor, MAX30100 pulse oximeter, and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor into a vest.
This setup continuously monitors critical environmental and physiological parameters, providing real-time data to ensure miners' well-being.
The collected data is processed and transmitted to a central monitoring system (ThingSpeak), enabling prompt responses to potential dangers such as gas leaks, abnormal health readings, or adverse environmental conditions.
This innovative approach aims to mitigate risks and improve safety standards in mining operations.
